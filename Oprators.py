a = 4
b = 3

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b) # this will give remainder after dividing the number
print(a // b) # this // is a floor oprators, it round of the value to it's nearest integer
print(a ** b) # ** is used for know the power eg. a to power b

# *****COMMPARISION OPERATORS****
print(a > b) #is a greater than b
print(a < b) #is a less than b
print(a == b) #is a equal to b
print(a >= b) #is a greater than or equal to b
print(a <= b) #is a less than or equal to b
print(a != b) #is a not equal to be
